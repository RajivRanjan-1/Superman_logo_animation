<h2>Superman Logo with Turtle ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
This is a Python project that uses the built-in turtle library to draw the classic Superman "S" logo. The script creates a graphical window and draws the iconic shield and emblem step-by-step using a series of geometric commands.

<h3>Features</h3>
<li>Vector Graphics: Generates a clean, scalable vector image of the Superman logo.</li>
<li>Simple GUI: Creates a dedicated window for the drawing using turtle.Screen().</li>
<li>Code-based Art: Demonstrates how to create a complex shape using basic turtle commands like forward(), right(), left(), curve(), and fill().</li>
<li>Minimal Dependencies: Relies only on the turtle library, which is included with most standard Python installations.</li>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
To run this script, you just need Python 3.x installed on your system. No other packages are required.

<h3>How to Run</h3>
<li>Clone the repository (if you haven't already):</li>
<p>git clone https://github.com//RajivRanjan-1/Superman_logo_animation.git</p>
<p>cd Superman_logo_animation</p>

<li>Execute the script from your terminal:</li>
python Superman_logo_animation.py

<h4>A new window will open, and you will see the turtle drawing the logo in real-time. The window will stay open until you click on it.</h4>

<h3>Code Overview</h3>
The script uses a turtle.Turtle() object to draw the shapes. It employs a function called curve() to draw smooth, curved lines by repeatedly moving forward and turning slightly. The different parts of the logo (the red shield, the yellow and red "S") are created using a combination of straight lines, angles, and t.begin_fill() and t.end_fill() to color the shapes.
